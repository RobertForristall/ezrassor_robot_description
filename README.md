# ezrassor_robot_description
This is a ros humble package containing the robot description and simulation descriptions for the ezrassor rover.

This is developed by myself for educational purposes and is based off the ezrassor rover software developed by the Florida Space Institute for which I helped develop the ROS1 of their paver arm software
